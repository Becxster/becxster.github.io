                        Brazil with an emphasis on social impact. There, I fostered a diplomatic partnership between <em>Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie</em> and 
                        my home institution, Rice University. I also interned in a neuroimaging/signals research lab with <em>Dr. Paulo Boggio</em> and designed a social impact business 
                        called <em>EcoTuere</em>, aimed to make recycling and composting financially sustainable and incentivizing for Brazilians.

                        This experience was a humbling one. Solving social problems in the context of a different country,
                        with a different culture, people, values, history, language, structure of government, and goals is
                        not something a foreigner can do without lots of help from locals. I quickly realized that the most
                        important way to spend my time was to immerse myself in the São Paulo way of life, in order to learn
                        how Brazilians communicate and function, inside and out.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I took courses with Portuguese speaking students, who helped me learn the language. I dedicated
                        hours every day to learning Portuguese, and was fluent enough to express myself after a month — two
                        months later I could comfortably communicate with all citizens.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My partners at Mackenzie Presbyterian University helped me explore the issue of sustainability in
                        Brazil from all different perspectives, which allowed me to learn the context and depth behind the
                        problems Brazil faces related to environment. Together with a handful of Brazilian students from all
                        different disciplines, I visited recycling plants, water management companies, an indigenous peoples
                        reserve, museums, and much more.
