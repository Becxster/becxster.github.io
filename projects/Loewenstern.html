                        <p>In the summer of 2024, I was awarded <em>$8365</em> by Rice University to conduct a fellowship
                            in São Paulo,
                            Brazil with an emphasis on social impact. There, I fostered a diplomatic partnership between
                            <em>Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie</em> and
                            my home institution, Rice University. I also interned in a neuroimaging/signals research lab
                            with <em>Dr. Paulo Boggio</em> and designed a social impact business
                            called <em>EcoTuere</em>, aimed to make recycling and composting financially sustainable and
                            incentivizing for Brazilians.

                I worked under Dr. Paulo Boggio, head of the <a href="https://inctsani.org/" target="_blank">Social and
                    Affective Neuroscience Institute</a> to
                research the temporal brain activity happening under the hood in research subjects when their brains
                create false memories. This project was completed
                by a team of two Brazilian students and myself, and spanned 3 months in the summer of 2024. This task
                involved learning to safely apply the delicate EEG
                electrode array onto the heads of subjects, monitoring signal data from the electrodes, and using EEGLAB
                to analyze & average data across trials.
                <br><br>
                In order to find trends in the functional response of the brain when subjects are shown a list of words,
                then asked later to identify which items they
                had already seen in a list of semantically similar words. When the user identifies a word as previously
                seen, it was noted whether they were correct or
                if this was a "false memory," then the other researchers and I analyzed their brain during the event
                using a concept called ERPs (event-related potentials).

                    One problem I noticed in Brazil was the extremely low rate of recycling and composting among Brazilian
                    citizens. This is not a problem specific to Brazil — citizens of the United States only recycle 24% of
                    their Municipal Solid Waste and compost 9% — but the numbers are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772427123000621#tbl0001">much lower</a> 
                    in Brazil (around 1.47% is recycled and 0.168% is composted).
                    <br><br>
                    But I had visited numerous recycling and material recovery facilities in Brazil, who explained to me
                    that they were always on the lookout for new clients to send them recycled materials. Furthermore, I
                    learned that Brazil achieved a 100% recycling rate for aluminum cans in 2023, the highest in the world.
                    So why were the recycling rates so low?
                    <br><br>
                    The problem is that Brazilian citizens do not have enough incentive to consciously recycle all the time.
                    The reason their recycling rates for aluminum cans is so high, for instance, is due to the existence of
                    a system where 1 kilogram of aluminum cans can be traded for 5 Reais, equivalent to around $1 USD. This
                    incentivizes jobless Brazilians to collect discarded cans and bring them to recycling facilities.
                    Recycling rates for other materials are 
                    <a href="https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/geral/noticia/2022-06/indice-de-reciclagem-no-brasil-e-de-4-diz-abrelpe" target="_blank">as low as 4%</a>
                    <br><br>
                    So I worked with some Brazilian students to develop a business which would solve this problem: EcoTuere.
                    The idea was to create recycling bins with scales and touchscreens attached, and strategically place
                    them in areas commonly visited and easily-accessible such as gas stations and schools. Our organization
                    would partner with a company called STIX, which awards members who sign up for their free loyalty
                    program with discounts from stores they are partnered when shopping at these locations. Just as STIX
                    members could receive discounts by shopping at partnered stores, they could also receive discounts from
                    dumping recycled materials into our EcoTuere bins, which we would sell to material recovery facilities.
                    <br><br>
                    EcoTuere gives Brazilians a crucial financial incentive to recycle, which will increase recycling rates
                    in Brazil. Material recovery facilities in Brazil are already advanced enough to handle almost anything
                    you throw at them — by sending them more separated recycling, we can increase their profitability and
                    production of post-consumer material, promoting a circular economy in Brazil.

        This experience was a humbling one. Solving social problems in the context of a different country,
        with a different culture, people, values, history, language, structure of government, and goals is
        not something a foreigner can do without lots of help from locals. I quickly realized that the most
        important way to spend my time was to immerse myself in the São Paulo way of life, in order to learn
        how Brazilians communicate and function, inside and out.
        <br>
        <br>
        I took courses with Portuguese speaking students, who helped me learn the language. I dedicated
        hours every day to learning Portuguese, and was fluent enough to express myself after a month — two
        months later I could comfortably communicate with all citizens.
        <br>
        <br>
        My partners at Mackenzie Presbyterian University helped me explore the issue of sustainability in
        Brazil from all different perspectives, which allowed me to learn the context and depth behind the
        problems Brazil faces related to environment. Together with a handful of Brazilian students from all
        different disciplines, I visited recycling plants, water management companies, an indigenous peoples
        reserve, museums, and much more.
